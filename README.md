HelpMateAI-Project
Introduction
HelpMateAI is an AI-powered Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to assist with insurance-related queries. It efficiently retrieves information from insurance documents and generates precise responses using LLMs like GPT-3.5. The system incorporates semantic search, cross-encoder re-ranking, and LLM-based response generation to ensure that answers are fact-based and contextually accurate.

The project leverages vector embeddings and retrieval mechanisms to enhance the accuracy of insurance-related information retrieval. It is designed to work with a predefined set of insurance documents that are preprocessed and stored in a vector database. Users can ask natural language queries, and the system fetches the most relevant sections, refines the ranking using a cross-encoder, and generates a well-structured answer with citations.

Problem Statement
Insurance policies and legal documents are often lengthy and difficult to navigate. Users, including policyholders, agents, and legal teams, may need quick access to specific details regarding coverage, claims, and policy terms.

Challenges:

Complexity of Documents: Insurance documents contain technical jargon and are often hundreds of pages long.
Time-Consuming Manual Search: Finding specific clauses in large documents requires manual reading and keyword-based searches, which may miss context.
Inconsistent Answers: Traditional search engines return entire documents, leaving users to extract relevant information manually.
Contextual Relevance: Simple keyword-based searches lack semantic understanding and may return irrelevant sections.
Goal: Develop an AI-driven system that automates the extraction of relevant insurance policy details, ranks retrieved information accurately, and generates precise answers with citations.

Approach
The project uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which combines document retrieval and text generation.

Document Processing & Storage

Extracts text from PDF insurance documents using pdfplumber.
Splits documents into fixed-size text chunks.
Converts chunks into vector embeddings using SentenceTransformer.
Stores embeddings in a vector database (ChromaDB) for fast retrieval.
Query Processing & Document Retrieval

Encodes the user’s query into an embedding using the same model.
Performs similarity search in ChromaDB to retrieve the top-K relevant chunks.
Applies a Cross-Encoder model to re-rank the retrieved results for higher accuracy.
Answer Generation & Citation

The top 3 most relevant chunks are passed to GPT-3.5.
The model generates a well-structured answer, grounded in retrieved documents.
Includes citations (document name and page number).
User Query Handling & API Support

Allows users to send queries via a Python script or API.
Retrieves precise insurance-related information.
Provides a concise answer instead of entire documents.
System Design
The system consists of three key components:

1. Document Processing & Vector Store
Preprocessing: Extract text from PDFs.
Chunking: Divide text into fixed-size blocks.
Embedding: Convert chunks into numerical vector representations.
Storage: Save vectors in ChromaDB.
2. Query Processing & Retrieval
Query Embedding: Convert user query into a vector representation.
Vector Search: Find similar embeddings in ChromaDB.
Re-ranking: Use a Cross-Encoder model to rank retrieved results.
3. Answer Generation
Input: User query + retrieved document chunks.
LLM Processing: GPT-3.5 generates an answer based on the provided context.
Output: A precise, cited response.
Current Implementation
The system follows a structured workflow to retrieve and generate responses. Below is the core logic:

1. Query Processing
query = "What is the life insurance coverage for disability?"
df = search(query)  # Retrieve relevant documents
df = apply_cross_encoder(query, df)  # Re-rank results
df = get_topn(3, df)  # Select the top 3 most relevant chunks
response = generate_response(query, df)  # Generate final response
print("\n".join(response))  # Print the response
2. Optimized Query Handling Using Loops
queries = [
    "what is the life insurance coverage for disability",
    "what is the Proof of ADL Disability or Total Disability",
    "what is condition of death while not wearing Seat Belt"
]

def process_queries(queries):
    results = {}
    for query in queries:
        df = search(query)
        df = apply_cross_encoder(query, df)
        df = get_topn(3, df)
        response = generate_response(query, df)
        results[query] = "\n".join(response)
        print(f"\nQuery: {query}\n")
        print(results[query])
    
    return results

responses = process_queries(queries)
3. API Endpoint for External Integration
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI()

class QueryRequest(BaseModel):
    query: str

@app.post("/query")
def answer_query(request: QueryRequest):
    df = search(request.query)
    df = apply_cross_encoder(request.query, df)
    df = get_topn(3, df)
    response = generate_response(request.query, df)
    return {"query": request.query, "response": response}
